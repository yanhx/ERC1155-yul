# ERC 1155 Implementation in Yul

## About the project

Part of the Rareskills course, this project was for us to master Yul and more importantly understand how Solidity works under the hood. Through this we were forced to understand how Solidity handles memory, storage, parameters when a function is called and how values are returned at the end of the execution of a function.
